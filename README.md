# Plotly Dash
This repository contains work done for the Plotly Dash Bootcamp instructed by Jose Portilla. There are several instances where I took the basic concepts taught in the bootcamp and I expanded upon them to challenge myself. In order to do just that, I had to explore the Plotly documentation to see how customizable these visualizations actually are. Plotly in its own right is exceptionally customizable. When paired with Dash's style and layout customizations, you can fine-tune any visualization you want to create. Seaborn visualizations can also be utilized with Dash.
